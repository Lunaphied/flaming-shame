Java Deobfuscator
==============

This is a program for analyzing and comparing graphs of
structures of java programs to provide automatic deobfuscation.

This program will not give exact mappings, rather a best guess of mappings.
This is a limitation of the nature of compiled and obfuscated bytecode.
